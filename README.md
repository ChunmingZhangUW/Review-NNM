Readme File: Copy all five directories into a common directory.

1. Numerical Experiments for CNN

   To conduct numerical experiments for CNN, go to the directory 'Matlab_for_CNN/':

    Run "Realdata_MNIST_CNN.m". This script generates the results in Section 6.3.

2. Numerical Experiments for LSTM

   To conduct numerical experiments for LSTM, go to the directory 'Matlab_for_LSTM/':

    Run "simulation_LSTM.m". This script generates the simulation study results in Section B.1.
    Run "Realdata_LSTM.m".   This script generates the real data analysis results in Section B.2.

3. Numerical Experiments for FNN (Nonparametric Regression)

   To conduct numerical experiments for FNN applied to nonparametric regression, go to the directory 'Matlab_for_nonparametric-regression/':

    Run "non_para_func_est_NN.m". This script generates the numerical study results in Section 3.
